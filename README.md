Fantasy Football Hybrid Standings
===========

How Do I Get it?
------
Download from the Chrome Web Store at:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hybrid-fantasy-football-s/defieefkkhbdajheandkjdenpjolcpgd

Once installed, an options menu will appear. Go to your ESPN league that uses hybrid standings and copy the 'leagueId' from the URL and paste it in the input box on the options menu. Don't forget to save!

What is this?
------
This extension provides users with the ability to see the standings of their league on ESPN if their league uses a hybrid scoring system. No more do league managers have to keep track of this by hand or on the side, it's all taken care for you and now everyone in the league can see the hybrid standings straight from the ESPN Standings page!

Hybrid scoring is a combination of H2H and points based scoring that eliminates the luck of scheduling from the game. Every week you have the ability to get 2 wins. 1 win you get by winning your matchup. The second "win" you get if you finish the week in the top half of scores.  For example if you put up 110 and your opponent puts up 120, but your score of 110 would have beat anyone else that week you would go 1-1 that week while your opponent would go 2-0.

 It looks like this:

* Make alert to remind LM to adjust playoff schedule based on hybrid stndings

Known Issues
